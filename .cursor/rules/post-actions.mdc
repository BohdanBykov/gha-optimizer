MANDATORY VALIDATION SEQUENCE:
- before running any python tools make sure you use venv

ALWAYS RUN IF MAKING CODE CHANGES:
- python test_cli.py                  
- black src/
- isort src/
- flake8 src/                           # Linting (fix critical issues only)
- mypy src/gha_optimizer                # Type checking (fix type errors)
- bandit -r src/gha_optimizer           # Security scanning (fix security issues)

ALL MUST PASS - fix issues before proceeding.
