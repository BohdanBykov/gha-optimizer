# Changelog

This changelog is automatically generated during releases from git commit messages.

For the latest changes, see: https://github.com/BohdanBykov/gha-optimizer/releases

## How it works

- Commit messages should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Changelog is generated automatically during releases from git history
- Each release creates a new changelog entry with commits since the last tag

## Conventional Commit Examples

chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```
